# VGG-16-architecture-implementation

VGG16 is object detection and classification algorithm which is able to classify 1000 images of 1000 different categories with 92.7% accuracy. It is one of the popular algorithms for image classification and is easy to use with transfer learning.

A convolutional neural network is also known as a ConvNet, which is a kind of artificial neural network. A convolutional neural network has an input layer, an output layer, and various hidden layers. VGG16 is a type of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is considered to be one of the best computer vision models to date. The creators of this model evaluated the networks and increased the depth using an architecture with very small (3 × 3) convolution filters, which showed a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations. They pushed the depth to 16–19 weight layers making it approx — 138 trainable parameters.
